### Note:

- Need colors that'll blend in with the glassmorphism.

## IDEAS

1. randomly floating text in the background with the above words???? I should be able to
   control the dark and light mode for those texts also.
   A similar tutorial can be found in the brave bookmarks.

## TO FIX:

- the custom cursor doesn't work properly in firefox browser?
- the background glitch is caused by the cursor animation function maybe defining it everywhere is not a good idea.
  NOTE:this issue doesnt happen in contact and home page.
- Refactor the projects card to be more responsive and how the data is mapped and labels etc.

## TODO:

- update the projects card details.
- add email js to the contact form.
- move the photos showcase logic calculation to another next js project

## Blogs ideas:

1.custom cursor with framer-motion and react js

- yarn add framer-motion
- get cursor position
- set the cursor position to the position of cursor div using framer-motion
- create default and animate variants
- use onMouseEnter & onMouseLeave functions the needed divs to toggle between the variants using useState
- set cursor-none if needed and pointer-events-none for the custom cursor to be able to be clickable.
