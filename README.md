## IDEAS

1. randomly floating text in the background with the above words???? I should be able to
   control the dark and light mode for those texts also.

## Blogs ideas:

1.custom cursor with framer-motion and react js

- yarn add framer-motion
- get cursor position
- set the cursor position to the position of cursor div using framer-motion
- create default and animate variants
- use onMouseEnter & onMouseLeave functions the needed divs to toggle between the variants using useState
- set cursor-none if needed and pointer-events-none for the custom cursor to be able to be clickable.

  2.Darkmode with tailwind css with hydration error handled.

- yarn add next-themes
- Wrap app js with the theme provider from next-themes
- Change darkMode='class' in tailwind.config.js
- Use useTheme() hook to check for system theme and handle theme toggle
- Use useState() to handle the hydration error
